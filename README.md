# Definition

textMedley is a language dedicated to text generation. Its core is written in Haxe so it can be used in all contexts that Haxe can target. 

/!\ Since textMedley uses regular expressions there may be some tiny differences accross plateforms.

# The language

The language is used to describe a set of rules, each having a set of blocks. Here's a simple example:

```
#main:
    -output:
        hello!
        goodbye!
        woops, I don't know what to say
#end
```

It starts by a `#` followed by an identifier and finished with the `#end` tag. Here I chose the `main` identifier as it is usally the starting point.

Inside, you find a block named `output`. That block tell the expression that will be returned, which here will be randomly selected between `hello!`, `goodbye!` and `woops, I don't know what to say`. 

The way it works is that the `output` block contains a series of expressions, one per non-empty line and returns one randomly. Each expression is trimmed so the space around doesn't matter. However, if you want your expression to start with some space you can put it beetween `"` so it it kept from trimming.

You can reference a rule inside expression by using its name the same way you declare it. The next example says randomly hello or goodbye to a random name:

```
#main:
    -output:
        hello #name!
        goodbye #name!
#end

#name:
    -output:
        John
        Paul
        world
#end
```

There is not restrictions on rules use and you can event make recursive references.

The last feature is the use of variables. Since referencing a rule always outputs a random result, or when you want to reuse a long expression, you can define variables and use them later, using the `vars` block, like this:

```
#main:
    -vars:
        $name = #name

    -output:
        hello $name!
        goodbye $name!
        this time it is $name and only $name
#end

#name:
    -output:
        John
        Paul
        world
#end
```

Here on the last output, $name always has the same content.

Finally, a rule can take parameters to use in its body like variables. For example:

```
#main:
    -output:
        #greet(#name)
        #greettwo(#name, Bond)
#end

#greet($name):
    -output:
        hello $name
        goodbye $name
#end

#greettwo($name, $lastname):
    -output:
        my name is $lastname, $name $lastname
#end

#name:
    -output:
        John
        Paul
        world
#end
```

Here greet and greettwo take parameters.

# Usage

There are three ways of using TextMedley : either with its interpreter, its compiler or a haxe macro.

For the interpreter and the compiler, you first have to instanciate a `BlockList` by giving a string containg the TextMedley source code. This is the base block for those uses. For the following examples I will use javascript.

```js
let code = "#main: -output: hello end#";
let blockList = new textMeldey.BlockList(code);
```

## Interpreter

Then you can generate a text using the `eval_main` method

```js
console.log(blockList.eval_main())
```

`eval_main` will assume that your TextMedley code has a block named `main`. You can also use the method `eval` (which `eval_main` is based on) to use the block of your choice as your entry point.

```js
console.log(blockList.eval("main")) //same as calling eval_main()
console.log(blockList.eval("other"))
```

## Compiler

You can also build a compiler to translate TextMedley langage to any programming language that supports all of the following concepts :

- string manipulation
- variables
- functions

Those 4 concepts allow for an easy translation. However, there are some languages that don't fit in but should be targted using some work-around. In some way I may suggest that all programming languages are supported, but I'd rather say that I didn't take the time to check them all :)

Anyway, to compile to a language you will need both the BlockList instanciated with the TextMedley source code and an object that tell how to translate it. You can then either use a built-in one among those listed in the `src/compilers` folder or create one yourself. Then you can generate the source code using the `compile` method like this :

```js
let compiler = new compiler.ruby.Compiler()
console.log(blockList.compile(compiler)) // prints Ruby code
```
### Create a compiler

## Macro

Finally, you can use a macro in your haxe code to turn you TextMedley code into haxe functions d√©finitions. For example, if we take the following code:

```haxe
@:build(textMedley.Macros.codify('./params.txt'))
class Generator{}
```

And some TextMeldey code in the `params.txt` file in the same forlder:

```
#main:
    -output:
        hello #name!
        goodbye #name!
#end

#name:
    -output:
        John
        Paul
        world
#end
```

This will generate for you the static functions `Generator.main` and `Generator.name`.

## How to build

You can build textMedley using Haxe (up to date) and Make like this

```
haxe --main textMedley.Compile --interp -D lang=$target
```

where `$target` can be :
- js
- php
- cpp
- cs
- java
- jvm
- python
- lua
